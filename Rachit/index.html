        <h1>Forest Fire</h1>
        <br>
        <hr class="ruler">
        <div>The most common hazard in forests is forests fire. Forests fires are as old as the forests themselves. They pose a threat not only to the forest wealth but also to the entire regime to fauna and flora seriously disturbing the bio-diversity and the ecology and environment of a region. During summer, when there is no rain for months, the forests become littered with dry senescent leaves and twinges, which could burst into flames ignited by the slightest spark. The Himalayan forests, particularly, Garhwal Himalayas have been burning regularly during the last few summers, with colossal loss of vegetation cover of that region.</div>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Causes of Forest Fire</h2>
        <hr class="ruler">
        <div>Forest fires are caused by Natural causes as well as Man made causes</div>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Natural causes :-</b> Many forest fires start from natural causes such as lightning which set trees on fire. However, rain extinguishes such fires without causing much damage. High atmospheric temperatures and dryness (low humidity) offer favorable circumstance for a fire to start.</li>
            <li><b>Man made causes :-</b>Fire is caused when a source of fire like naked flame, cigarette or bidi, electric spark or any source of ignition comes into contact with inflammable material.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Classification of Forest Fire</h2>
        <hr class="ruler">
        <div>Forest fire can broadly be classified into three categories:</div>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Natural or controlled forest fire.</li>
            <li>Forest fires caused by heat generated in the litter and other biomes in summer through carelessness of people (human neglect).</li>
            <li>Forest fires purposely caused by local inhabitants.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Types of Forest Fire</h2>
        <hr class="ruler">
        <div>The types of forest fire are as follows:</div>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Surface Fire :-</b>A forest fire may burn primarily as a surface fire, spreading along the ground as the surface litter (senescent leaves and twigs and dry grasses etc) on the forest floor and is engulfed by the spreading flames.</li>
            <li><b>Underground Fire :-</b>The fires of low intensity, consuming the organic matter beneath and the surface litter of forest floor are sub-grouped as underground fire. In most of the dense forests a thick mantle of organic matter is find on top of the mineral soil. This fire spreads in by consuming such materials. These fires usually spread entirely underground and burn for some meters below the surface. This fire spreads very slowly and in most of the cases it becomes very hard to detect and control such type of fires. They may continue to burn for months and destroy vegetative cover of the soil. The other terminology for this type of fire is Muck fires.</li>
            <li><b>Ground Fire :-</b>These fires are fires in the sub surface organic fuels, such as duff layers under forest stands, Arctic tundra or taiga, and organic soils of swamps or bogs. There is no clear distinction between underground and ground fires. The smoldering under ground fires sometime changes into Ground fire. This fire burns root and other material on or beneath the surface i.e. burns the herbaceous growth on forest floor together with the layer of organic matter in various stages of decay. They are more damaging than surface fires, as they can destroy vegetation completely. Ground fires burn underneath the surface by smoldering combustion and are more often ignited by surface fires.</li>
            <li><b>Crown Fire :-</b>A crown fire is one in which the crown of trees and shrubs burn, often sustained by a surface fire. A crown fire is particularly very dangerous in a coniferous forest because resinous material given off burning logs burn furiously. On hill slopes, if the fire starts downhill, it spreads up fast as heated air adjacent to a slope tends to flow up the slope spreading flames along with it. If the fire starts uphill, there is less likelihood of it spreading downwards.</li>
            <li><b>Firestorms :-</b>Among the forest fires, the fire spreading most rapidly is the firestorm, which is an intense fire over a large area. As the fire burns, heat rises and air rushes in, causing the fire to grow. More air makes the fire spin violently like a storm. Flames fly out from the base and burning ember spew out the top of the fiery twister, starting smaller fires around it. Temperatures inside these storms can reach around 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Vulnerability</h2>
        <hr class="ruler">
        <div>The youngest mountain ranges of Himalayas are the most vulnerable stretches of the world susceptible to forest fires. The forests of Western are more frequently vulnerable to forest fires as compared to those in Eastern Himalayas. This is because forests of Eastern Himalayas grow in high rain density. With large scale expansion of chirr (Pine) forests in many areas of the Himalayas the frequency and intensity of forest fires has increased.</div>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Preparedness and Mitigation Measures</h2>
        <hr class="ruler">
        <div>Forest fires are usually seasonal. They usually start in the dry season and can be prevented by adequate precautions. Successive Five Year Plans have provided funds for forests fighting. During the British period, fire was prevented in the summer through removal of forest litter all along the forest boundary. This was called "Forest Fire Line" This line used to prevent fire breaking into the forest from one compartment to another. The collected litter was burnt in isolation. Generally, the fire spreads only if there is continuous supply of fuel (Dry vegetation) along its path. The best way to control a forest fire is therefore, to prevent it from spreading, which can be done by creating firebreaks in the shape of small clearings of ditches in the forests.</div>
        <br>
        <h3>Precautions</h3>
        <div>The followings are the important precautions against fire:</div>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>To keep the source of fire or source of ignition separated from combustible and inflammable material.</li>
            <li>To keep the source of fire under watch and control.</li>
            <li>Not allow combustible or inflammable material to pile up unnecessarily and to stock the same as per procedure recommended for safe storage of such combustible or inflammable material.</li>
            <li>To adopt safe practices in areas near forests viz. factories, coalmines, oil stores, chemical plants and even in household kitchens.</li>
            <li>To incorporate fire reducing and fire fighting techniques and equipment</li>
        </ol>
